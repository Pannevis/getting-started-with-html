  <title>CodePen - First steps at Udacity</title>

</head>

<body>

  <p> A bit nervous I <b> will </b> start writing down what I have learned</p>
<p>At first I took in some basic knowledge about the web during which I <em> didn't </em> take notes. <br> 
After those explanations <a href="www.udacity.com"> Udacity </a> began to teach me how to begin coding. I am still <br>
little hesitant to do so. However I will try!</p>

<p>They taught me about: <br> <br>
  * The difference between inline and block elements. Block elements
form an "invisible box" <br>
around the content inside of them.<Br>
  * Some examples of attributes like a hyperlink and an image </p>
  <p> I am looking forward to understaning programmers better for I will be in a team with some <br> and their role is quite important </p>
